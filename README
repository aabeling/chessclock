A very simple chessclock for an android device
using phonegap and pure HTML5+CSS3+Javascript.

At the moment it only shows to clock starting at five minutes.
On click on one of the clocks the clock starts to count down.
When the clock is clicked again the other clock starts.
When the time of one clock is expired it stops and is marked with
a red background.

It was just a first test of phonegap.

To get it running you should do the following:
- import the project into eclipse
- Run as... Android Application

The application can be installed from my public dropbox at
